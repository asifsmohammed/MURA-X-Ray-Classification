# MURA-X-Ray-Classification
Classified abnormalities in X-ray images with musculoskeletal conditions using MURA dataset. 
Applied OpenCV image pre processing, image enhancement techniques and trained Logistic Regression, SVM with RBF kernel, Bagging and Gradient Boosting and achieved 55\% accuracy.
Improved the test accuracy to 60\% by increasing the size of training data using data augmentation and trained a CNN model.
